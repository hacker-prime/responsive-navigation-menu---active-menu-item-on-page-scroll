# responsive-navigation-menu---active-menu-item-on-page-scroll
I encountered the active menu item on page scroll feature in a YouTube video named Responsive Personal Portfolio Website HTML CSS And JAVASCRIPT | Mobile First by Bedimcode. I didn’t understand how it worked when I looked at the code and Bedimcode doesn’t speak in his videos or provide annotations or subtitles. So I tried to figure it out and I believe I have a full grasp of it now.
